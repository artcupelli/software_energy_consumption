# Software Energy Consuption Research

Scripts and documentation for the experiments in software energy consumption research (University of São Paulo). 
This project is oriented by Professor Daniel Cordeiro, Professor Fábio Nakano and Professor Flávio Coutinho. 


## Approaches for measuring energy consumption
During the research we are experimenting two approaches for measuring the energy consumption: using a physical meter device; capturing processor data. Check both subfolders in this repository for more information on the results.
